# SUMM full stack coding challenge 

As the next step in our interview process, we'd like you to complete a small coding challenge.

## The project

You will build a small full stack app with Python/Django and TypeScript/React.
The goal is to be able to use all CRUD operations in a simple webapp for the translation objects when you 
are logged in. To keep authentication simple use Firebase Authentication (you should not push your secrets 
for firebase of course).

A translation object is a simple object consisting of the attributes:

| Attribute  | Datatype |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Id         | Integer  |
| InputText  | String   |
| OutputText | String   |
| FromUser | String   |

You have to implement the following functions in the front and back end, so a user is able to:
1. register and login
2. create a new translation object
3. update an existing translation
4. Read one translation object
5. Read all translation objects
6. Delete a translation object

There are no rules on how the front end should look like, be creative but keep it simple and user 
friendly.

## Additional Information

- Here is a small tutorial of how to build a Django app: https://realpython.com/django-setup/
- Easiest use create-react-app for creating the React front end: 
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started
- using ORM for DB operations
- Test your code
- You can use all external libraries you find
- Have fun and do not overengineer it
- show us your skills in the commits that you have a clear structure in the code
- Reach out to me (Nicholas) if you have any questions

## Evaluation criteria
- Functionality
- Code quality
- Test quality

## How to submit

1. Create a new repo (public or private where you invite me, as you like)
2. Work on your solution (create meaningful commits; best to finish the project in one session so we can 
better review the commits)
3. (optional) Deploy the frontend and backend of your application using any suitable service (heroku, 
etc.)
4. Send me a link of your repo to submit

## Timeframe

You can complete the challenge within one week. If you need more time, please reach out to us. You will 
not be judged on how quickly you complete the challenge.
